Change is good. Change of place, change of process, change of outlook. Change is what advances us as individuals and as a community. I love the idea of disrupting stagnant industries and creating new solutions to old problems.

Most of the work that I love to do is focused on this theme. Because, to change something is to remember what it once was, and to inspire an even brighter future.

##Growing up
I grew up in Farnham, Surrey – a small market town in England.

##1999
After finishing school I went to live in Australia for a while. I travelled Vietnam, Laos, Peru, Bolivia, and worked odd jobs like zucchini picking, answering phones, moving office furniture, bar tending. Two years later, I returned to the UK to study Geology at Edinburgh University. I travelled some more during the holidays: Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Malaysia, Scottish Highlands and islands.

##2001
In 2005 I graduated with a Bachelor of Science (with honours) from Edinburgh University. I am the first in my family to get a degree.

##2005
I went straight to work as a Geologist on oil and gas drilling platforms in the North Sea.

##2007
During my time off from the rigs I learnt web design, and eventually left the rigs to build an online magazine and community I'd been dreaming about -- I called it Make Travel Fair.

##2009
Over the next couple of years it won some awards and eventually a group of travel companies decided they liked it and acquired it, I went to work (from home) at one of them. I was 27 years old.

I travelled some more for work and just to keep moving: South Africa, New Zealand, Cook Islands, Indonesia. In 2011 the company I was working for folded -- my equity was worth nothing and Make Travel Fair left with me.

> "Stephen is a creative driven professional. Stephen exudes entrepreneurship in abundance and is always abreast of the latest trends and technologies that have relevance to his position.

##2011
After leaving the travel industry I was recruited into the development world to work on a new project at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington D.C., aiming to usher in a new era of web-based technology and connectedness to a very paper-based and administration entrenched culture.

I left the U.K. for the U.S. in December 2011 to marry my American wife. We now live in Washington D.C. with our young daughter.

##2012
At the end of 2012 I began working part-time on digital marketing for the Eat Good Food Group in Alexandria, VA.

##2015
I currently balance this with freelance work and raising my one-year old daughter.
