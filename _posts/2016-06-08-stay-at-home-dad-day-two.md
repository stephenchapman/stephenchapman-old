By 8:30am I was ready to quit. She wanted to make pizza dough, he was crying for something, there was no way I could placate them both at the same time. 

Looking after a toddler and a newborn is hard. Did I mention that already? Fortunately the day improved somewhat after the early morning passed. I started the day with a run. I left the house at 5:15am, hoping that by seizing some time for myself, and gettign a jump on the day, my morning might improve. The run and the uiet hour after I returned home were wonderful, I even got a little work done.

My wife returned home in the afternoon much to my relief.
