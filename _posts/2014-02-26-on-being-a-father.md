In the space of a day not only did our situation change, the speed of life changed.

My wife gave birth a month ago - it feels like a year.

Of course, it hasn't been a year, and it's not that life has slowed, or even sped up, it's just that our new reference point for the pace at which life advances sits on the living room floor, changing so much everyday.

"Haven't you grown! you're so tall!" We all heard it as children. Going up a shoe size, losing teeth; physical change is obvious when we're small. Once you enter your twenties all that seems to stop, we don't age. Of course it doesn't actually stop, we just don't see it, we feel suspended in a constant state of ageless glory.

It seems to kick back when you enter your fifties, at least that's what I've observed in my parents (and they've said it themselves). Physically you start to change again, and the pace at which life moves through us all is once again evident.

My daughter is only one month old, yet already I feel I understand vastly more about life than I did last month. No longer am I merely a passenger through an egocentric life, I am participating in the very essence of our continued existence, as my parents once did, and as we have done as a race for thousands of years.

She smiled at me for the first time this week, and lost the dried up remains of her umbilical cord.
