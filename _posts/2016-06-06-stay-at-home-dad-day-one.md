## It was fairly easy with one child

Now we have two children, two years apart, I have no idea how this is going to work. Today my wife returned to the office after ten weeks maternity leave, I stayed at home with the kids. 

I've been a stay-at-home dad for the last couple of years. We have a two-and-a-half-year-old daughter, and a two-and-a-half-month-old-son. With her toddler curiosity and his newborn needs this is a different job entirely.

Today wasn't really even my first day. My mother is staying with us until the end of the week and my wife will be part-time for the next two months. Despite this, the reality of caring for two little people at the same time became frightfully apparant today.

She wants to paint (outdoors at her table in the sunshine), he needs to nap (in a quiet dark room). She  wants to do a puzzle (on the floor), he wants to be bounced up and down (in the Baby Bjorn that's strapped to my chest).
