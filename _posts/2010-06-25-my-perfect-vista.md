Feelings of independence and isolation, yet also of being together and connected is why this scene stirred my emotions.  Early encounters like this with the day are rare, despite being such a predictable and accessible occurrence.  It was the beginning of a six-month trip away from home for us.

A cool 45-minute walk through the darkness, bleary eyed, and excited – the novelty of being up so early, ahead of the world in such a special place on your travels, always kickstarts the system.  It’s like being let in on a secret by Mother Nature.

The sandy path meandered loosely through a forest of native pohutukawa trees, easing gently down to the deserted sandstone cove.  The soothing sound of water lapped against the shore, patiently respecting the tranquillity and half-light of dawn.  These are the moments I live for.

Travelling has a way of creating space for these experiences.  Unshackled from daily commitments, we settle into a slower pace and surrender to the beat of a different drum.  It’s a pleasant feeling. Whilst awaiting the majesty of the sun there’s always a period of true serenity where no words are needed, and those that are spoken are gently whispered.

This was a trip that had been so long in the dreaming and the making, it was now unfolding and boy was it all worth it.  We’d each seen so many sunrises apart, living on separate sides of the Atlantic, now sharing a moment like this far from the crowds, and together was always going to be special.
